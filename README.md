Quarry WebUI
============

Quarry WebUI is a browser front end for infrastructure asset management. In its
current state, the implementation is heavily Ask.com-focused.

BIG NOTE ABOUT CODE USABILITY
=============================

We have decided to push the quarry-webui codebase up to github in a currently
unusable state. There are still known bugs and functional problems that have
cropped up as we have been extracting Ask.com specific code and generally
cleaning things up. We feel that it is more important for us to start getting
used to working out of the opensource project on github than it is for the
code to actually work at this point. Additionally, the backend API connector
code (app/quarry-data.js) assumes a very particular Ask.com environment running
the woodstove framework.

So as it stands now quarry-webui is an active work in progress. When the
codebase is sufficiently abstracted from the specifics of the Ask.com
environment we'll remove this note!
